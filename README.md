# Spotify Mood Melodies

---

## Description
Spotify Mood Melodies is a web application that generates personalized Spotify playlists based on a user's current mood. By connecting to the Spotify API and using simple mood input (text selection or slider), the app curates a sequence of tracks that match the chosen emotional tone, energy, and tempo to create a cohesive listening experience.

## Inspiration

---
This project was inspired by how powerful music can be at shaping and reflecting mood. I wanted a lightweight, intuitive app that lets users instantly generate playlists tailored to how they feel — whether they need focus, relaxation, motivation, or nostalgia — using Spotify's vast catalog and audio features.

## Components

- #### Frontend (web client)
  - Built with a modern JavaScript framework (React, Vue, or similar)
  - UI to select or describe mood (e.g., mood selector, sliders for energy/tempo)
  - Spotify OAuth sign-in to access user’s account and to create/save playlists
  - Playlist preview and playback controls (via Spotify Web Playback SDK or embedded player)

- #### Backend (API / integration layer)
  - Handles Spotify OAuth token exchange and refresh
  - Calls Spotify Web API to search for tracks, get audio features, and create playlists
  - Implements playlist generation logic that filters and sorts tracks to match mood parameters
  - Rate-limits and caches requests as needed

- #### Recommendation / Matching Engine
  - Maps mood inputs to Spotify audio features (valence, energy, tempo, danceability, etc.)
  - Uses simple heuristics or a lightweight model to score and rank candidate tracks
  - Optionally supports user preferences and history to refine suggestions
